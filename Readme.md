Sublime 4 Autohotkey (Deprecated)
===============================
  
> Most of the Su4AHK features are now added to the [default AutoHotkey package](http://github.com/ahkscript/SublimeAutoHotkey) for Sublime Text. Everybody is recommended to use that instead. Here is an outline on how to use these features.
* GoTo help - Use sublime's goto symbol feature (Ctrl + R)
* Tooltip help - See [ahkpopuphelp](https://github.com/ahkscript/SublimeAutoHotkey#ahkpopuphelp). Use <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+H</kbd>.
* F1 help - See [here](https://github.com/ahkscript/SublimeAutoHotkey#goto-documentation-integration). A default functionality will be added soon.
* Msgbox Creator - It will be added soon.

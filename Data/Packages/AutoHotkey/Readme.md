AutoHotkey Sublime-Text Package
===============================

### Installing ###
If you have Package Control installed, in command palette type  
` Package Control: Add Repository `  
Then add ` https://github.com/Avi-Aryan/AutoHotKey ` to it.  
Now, the package will be available for Install.  
  
If you don't have Package control, you can download the zip and replace the package with the default Autohotkey Package if you have.  

#### Brief ####
This is a Autohotkey package for Sublime Text.  
It has better Auto-Completes , Syntax-Highlighting and Language Files plus bonus custom themes and ahk scripts to make it even better.

#### Tips ####
* Make sure to **change Autohotkey.sublime-build** according to your requirements.  
* Use Auto-Complete Adder to add custom Auto-completes.  
* Dont worry about two Msgbox's in Autocomplete. `<blank> ` is for  
`Msgbox,text 			;(used in testing)` whereas other is for the whole long command.
* Similarly Loop has 5 variants each for `general`, `reading files and folders` , `parsing a string `  
,`registry reading ` and `reading lines from file ` .
